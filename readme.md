MEMORYGAME


create board of 3x4 cards. 
Card requirements: 6 colours, so cards are paired, and they need to be assigned to board randomly.
Cards are grey.
Click on single card makes it 'turn over' and specific, assigned to it colour is visible.
When 1 is turned over, wait for another click, and happens the same.
When these colours turn out to be the same, they stay out there with colour visible;
    if colours are different - after 3 seconds they turn grey again.
when all are discovered, info about win and button for 'play again'
